Detecting COVID-19 in medical images with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning

Steps to Execute:
1. Train the model using following command

   python train_MI.py --dataset dataset
   
2. Open the tensorboard using the following to visualize the training process and graph

   tensorboard --logdir=logs\\\fits
